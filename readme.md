**Hello I'm d00x and a White-Hat!**

I work in cyber security and my passion alongside my job is programming and developing software and apps!

Much or almost everything that is not forked is set to private here because I only use GitHub for private purposes.

I love working with Linux because I personally don't know anything about Mac. Just make the world open source. My favorite distros are Karli and Arch.

All the best and Hack the Planet
